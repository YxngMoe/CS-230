# Questions? 

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client was one of the clients that I have recieved to work for while working in this course this term. Their software requirements consisted of 
Security, User Interface, User Experience, Styling Compatibility and Latency. They wanted me to create a software that will help their application run on multiple operating systems seamlessly. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
While wokring on this project I believe that I did really well on evaluating the problem they were having previously and conducting my own personal reasearch to find a reasonable solution so their application will meet all their software requirements.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that working through the design document really helps your train of thought because as you go into each step of the design document you tend to spark up more instintive ideas for the project that helps the project excel. 


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the design constraints. I would pick it because I noticed that it could need some imporovements on the way it was structured and planned out. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implemented all the users needs into the software design because I always made to sure to look for every detail written on the overview by them. Its always important to consider to go back and revise the docuements provided by the client to make sure they are recieving all they asked for in their docuemnt. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the designing software with a open minded technique looking for all outside resources to help this application run seamlessly, so what I did was thing about resources that I think will benefit this game, and I thought about AWS and the services that they provide that will help this applcaiton run in a way that will give them all the of software requiresment sthey asked for in the begginging.
